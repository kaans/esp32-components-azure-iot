# Component: Azure IoT

## Supported Azure IoT client functionality

The following table provides an overview of the functions which are currently supported by the
azure_iot component. In general, only client functionality is supported.

Basically all of the options listed are supported by the Azure IoT SDK, but most of them are not
implemented, yet. Some of the non-implemented functionality is already prepared in code, but
disabled and, thus, not yet usable.
