# Components

## Component: device configuration

The device configuration stores device-specific data and settings which belong to the device.
This includes, for example, the *device name* as well as a *device certificate and private key*.

The intention behind this component is to extract all data and settings of an individual device
that is likely to be used by other components as well. Each device should have a unique name that
does not need to be specified at several places on the device, but rather stored at one central
place and accessed from other components as needed.

Additionally, the *NVS partition for factory and device specific settings* can be enabled here.


## Component: OTA HTTPS update

This component provides a convenient way to check for and apply new firmware images via OTA over HTTPS.
It can start either a (temporary) task that, after having synchronized the clock via sntp,
checks a given remote URL for firmware updates or allows to call that function directly from another thread.

The function checks which firmware version is currently running and which version the remote image
has. If they are equal, nothing will be updated. If they are different, the function downloads the
image to the OTA partition which is not currently executed and applies it to the bootloader so that
the new image will be started on next reboot (if the update was downloaded successfully).

The update strategy is still quite basic, but can be extended to support more use cases like updating
only if a newer version is present (currently all firmwares are applied which have a different version,
even a lower version).
