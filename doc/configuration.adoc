# Storing configuration

The components support two different options to store configuration values:

1. Compile configuration into the binary firmware image
2. Store configuration on a https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_flash.html[NVS partition]

The first option is intended to be used during development, when having just a few devices or if
OTA updates are not needed. It is easier to setup but less flexible regarding individual device
configuration.

The second option is intended when using OTA, especially when the number of devices is more than just
a few. It will make automated deployment of new firmware images a lot easier, but requires additional
setup in advance.

## 1. Configuration in firmware

Storing all configuration in the firmware does not require any special setup. All settings, like
device name or certificates, are part of the firmware image and are flashed together with the
application onto the device.

The drawback of this approach is that the firmware image is usable only for that specific device.
In case you want to flash several devices with the same application but different configuration
settings (like different device names or certificates), you would need to generate a new binary firmware
image for each device individually. Especially when using OTA, this will be cumbersome because all
devices will need an individual image stored somewhere on a server. In that case, the NVS storage
provides a solution to separate the individual device config from the generic application.

The _configuration in firmware_ is enabled by default. In fact, it is enable if the _configuration in NVS_
is disabled. Thus, make sure that the option *Load config from NVS factory partition* in the
components is *disabled*.

The menuconfig will show the available configuration options that let you set the required values directly.

The _configuration in firmware_ is useful for local development or if you just have one or a few devices.

## 2. Configuration in NVS

The https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_flash.html[non-volatile storage (NVS)]
 is a library that is part of the ESP-IDF framework. It provides functionality
to store data and configuration on a separate partition which can be mounted and read by the
binary firmware image and OTA update images. It effectively allows to store all device specific (and
application independent) configuration outside the application firmware image. Thus, the
application image can be generic and deployed easily via OTA or any other mechanism to a large
number of devices without having to include any specific configuration for each device.

### Preparing the partition table

First, the https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/partition-tables.html[partition table]
must be created manually and configured in the `menuconfig`. Open the
menu entry `Partition Table` and make sure the entry `Partition Table` is set to `Custom partition table CSV`.
Enter the name of the CSV file containing the partition table in the entry `Custom partition CSV file`.

An example for a partition table with OTA and NVS enabled for a flash size of 4MB can be found in
the file `partitions_4MB_nvs_ota.csv` and below:

There are two nvs partitions: the default partition named *nvs* used to store e.g. wifi configuration and the partition named *nvs_factory* used for the components in this repository. The partition has a default size of 16K
but can be increased if needed.

The partition table is automatically built and flashed onto the device with the application image and bootloader.
The NVS partition itself needs to be generated an flashed manually.

### Generate the NVS partition

The NVS is a partition that needs to be build and flashed manually to each device.
It contains a namespaced key-value list of entries that can be read during runtime by the firmware image.

The contents of the NVS is specified in a CSV file and can contain configuration values itself
or load them from external files.
See https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_partition_gen.html[Partition generator utility]
for an overview of the format of the CSV file and
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/storage/nvs_flash.html[the NVS storage library]
overview for a detailed overview.

An example of the CSV file can be found in the file `nvs_factory.csv` or below:

[source]
----
key,type,encoding,value

client_crt,file,binary,../certs/client_certificate.pem
client_key,file,binary,../certs/client_private_key.pem

host_name,file,string,azure_iot_host_name.txt
con_str,file,string,azure_iot_connection_string.txt
id_scope,file,string,azure_iot_dps_id_scope.txt
----

The first line is a header.
The second line marks the beginning of the namespace _device_ which contains values used
by the _device config_ component.
The sixth line marks the beginning of the namespace _azure_ which contains values used 
by the _azure iot_ component.

The name of the namespace as well as the name of the keys can be configured individually in `menuconfig`
if the defaults are not suitable.

Espressif provides a 
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_partition_gen.html[Partition generator utility]
which creates a binary image of the NVS partition that can then be flashed to the ESP device.

The python script is part of the esp-idf component _nvs-flash_ and can be called as follows (when
the esp-idf framework is installed into ~/esp):

.Generate binary NVS image with 16K size
[source,bash]
----
python ~/esp/esp-idf/components/nvs_flash/nvs_partition_generator/nvs_partition_gen.py generate nvs_factory.csv nvs_factory_partition.bin 0x4000
----

The nvs partition described in `nvs_factory.csv` has nor been stored in the binary image file
`nvs_factory_partition.bin`.

### Flash the partition to the device

The binary NVS partition image cannot be flashed with the `idf.py` tool but must be flashed separately
to ech device individually. This can be done with the tool `esptool.py` and only needs to be done
whenever the configuration and, thus, the binary image changes.

First, you need to determine the destination address where the image needs to be flashed to. This address
depends on the layout of your partition table and can be retrieved with the tool `gen_esp32part.py`.
It is located in the esp-idf sdk at `components/partition_table/gen_esp32part.py`.

To get the addresses of the partitions from the partition table, make sure to first build the current
partition table (either with `idf.py build` or `idf.py partition_table`). The addresses are read from
the generated binary partition image (by default located in `build/partition_table/partition-table.bin `).

ota_0,app,ota_0,0x160000,1280K,
ota_1,app,ota_1,0x2a0000,1280K,
----

The address to flash the nvs partition image to is *0x10000*.

Next, the binary image can be flashed to the device. The following command uses 
https://github.com/espressif/esptool[esptool.py] for flashing the image to the device.
Make sure to *adjust the port*, the *target address* and the *name of the binary image file*.

[source,bash]
----
esptool.py -p COM3 --before default_reset --after no_reset write_flash 0x10000 nvs_factory_partition.bin
----

The NVS partition can now be access by the application. Feel free to store any device specific data
on there so that the application image can be generated as generic as possible.
